# Week 1 Reflections
Python is so **similar** to Java, yet so **different** in many ways I didn't initially expect. I was surprised when learning that the variable's type wasn't required as part of the variable initialization like in Java. Learning double instead of float as one of the primary data types was part of my Java education, but I understand why float is technically considered more simple to learn in this case. I learned that float stores less decimals in floating-point numbers which makes it a more **efficient** data type than double. I didn't know that you could check a variable type by using the `type()` built-in method for Python. Lastly, I was intrigued when realizing that converting non-string variables into strings simply required using the `str()` method because it is different in both Java and Swift. All in all, I'm excited to diversify my knowledge of programming by learning Python and hope to kickstart a better understanding for the code behind AI/ML algorithms.
