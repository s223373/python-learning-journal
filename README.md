# python-learning-journal
A repository to document my Python learning journey

## About Me
A passionate ice hockey fan and current high school who is working on developing a fantasy app with NHL statistics and hoping to integrate my knowledge of AI/ML from future learning in Python. I am a self-teaching Swift and SwiftUI as well as learning Python through college courses. 

## Goals for This Course
My objective is to relate all of my Java knowledge to the Python language including any of Python's unique features and to be able to switch comfortably between those two languages. If possible, I want to start learning more about how LLMs truly work in code on a basic level and challenge myself more in creative projects than I have done before. 

## My First Python Program
`print("Hello World!")`
